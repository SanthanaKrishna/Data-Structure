/**
 * Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the number of pairs in A whose sum is divisible by B.
 * Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo (109 + 7).
 * Note: Ensure to handle integer overflow when performing the calculations.
 * Input 1: A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] B = 2   Output 1: 4
 * Input 2: A = [5, 17, 100, 11] B = 28   Output 2: 1
 * Explanation 1: All pairs which are divisible by 2 are (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (3,5). So total 4 pairs.
 * Explanation 2: There is only one pair which is divisible by 28 is (17, 11)
