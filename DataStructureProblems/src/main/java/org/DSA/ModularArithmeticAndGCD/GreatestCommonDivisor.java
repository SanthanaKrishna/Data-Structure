/**
 * Given 2 non-negative integers A and B, find gcd(A, B)
 * GCD of 2 integers A and B is defined as the greatest integer 'g' such that 'g' is a divisor of both A and B.
 * Both A and B fit in a 32 bit signed integer.
 * Note: DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS.
 * Input 1: A = 4  B = 6  Output 1: 2
 * Input 2: A = 6  B = 7  Output 2: 1
 * Explanation 1: 2 divides both 4 and 6
 * Explanation 2: 1 divides both 6 and 7
