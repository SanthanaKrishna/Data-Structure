/**
 * Implement pow(A, B) % C.
 * In other words, given A, B and C, Find (AB % C).
 * Note: The remainders on division cannot be negative.
 * In other words, make sure the answer you return is non-negative.
 * Input 1: A = 2 B = 3 C = 3  Output 1: 2
 * Input 2: A = 3 B = 3 C = 1 Output 2: 0
 * Explanation 1: 2^3 % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2
 * Explanation 1: 3^3 % 1 = 27 % 1 = 0
